        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
            Hi I am a left-wing attorney working at a non-profit that provides free legal services to low income people
            on
            housing issues. Prior to going to law school, I studied mathematics and philosophy in undergrad. Ultimately
            I decided to
            leave
            the math field because I did not see the social or political relevance of studying math at the time.
            My experience and observation taught me that the perceived apoliticalness of the STEM field is both untrue
            and problematic.
            Moreover, with the growing right-wing and totalitarian trends in the United States (where I live), I have
            been increasingly concerned with the survelliance aparatus. <br> <br>
            Additionally, I have become acutely aware of my lack of real computer literacy. While I studied math, I was
            not interested in any other technical field at the time. As a result, my technological and scientific
            knowledge is woefully inadequate. With the growing proliferation of computers and internet technology, it
            feels that being proficient in computers is becoming the new literacy.
            <br> <br>
            All of these thoughts have motivated me to study computers. I have created this website to document my
            journey and to share my interests, projects and what I have learned.
            I hope you find it interesting!
