        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
            Hi I am a left-wing attorney working at a non-profit that provides free legal services to low income people
            on
            housing issues. Prior to going to law school, I studied mathematics and philosophy in undergrad. Ultimately
            I decided to
            leave
            the math field because I did not see the social or political relevance of studying math at the time.
            My experience and observation taught me that the perceived apoliticalness of the STEM field is both untrue
            and problematic.
            Moreover, with the growing right-wing and totalitarian trends in the United States (where I live), I have
            been increasingly concerned with the survelliance apparatus. <br> <br>
            Additionally, I have become acutely aware of my lack of real computer literacy. While I studied math, I was
            not interested in any other technical field at the time. As a result, my technological and scientific
            knowledge is woefully inadequate. With the growing proliferation of computers and internet technology, it
            feels that being proficient in computers is becoming the new literacy.
            <br> <br id="interests-heading">
            All of these thoughts have motivated me to study computers. I have created this website to document my
            journey and to share my interests, projects and what I have learned.
            I hope you find it interesting!

        <h3>INTERESTS</h3>
        <p>
            What I am interested in learning is a constantly evolving list. As I learn more about computers, I discover
            more that I do not know. As such, this list will never be complete (probably). Nevertheless, here is my
            current list of interests with a short explanation of what it is and why I am interested.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Web Development</h4>
                <p>
                    This one should be fairly self explanatory. Web development is the art/science of making websites. I
                    am interested in it because the internet is ubiquitous and being able to create high quality
                    websites is an incredibly useful skill. Making websites that are visually appealing and easy to use
                    can help contribute to leftist organizing.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Mobile App Development</h4>
                <p>
                    Mobile app development is the art/science of making applications for the phone. I am interested in
                    learning this as I think there is potential to create mobile apps that can help facilitate left-wing
                    organizing. For example, Signal is a messaging app that has seen increasing activist popularity
                    because of its security and privacy features.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Video game development</h4>
                <p>Video game development is the programing and design of video games. I like to play video games so
                    being able to make one, or at least understand how they are made would be cool. Plus I might be able
                    to contribute to modding games which can be fun.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Networking</h4>
                <p>Networking is the field that specializes in setting up connections between computers and connecting
                    these networks to the internet (which is just an even larger connection between computers). My
                    interest stems from the fact that I wish to learn how computers communicate with eachother. This
                    information is useful for anybody interested in cybersecurity as a lot of the vunerabilities for
                    privacy comes from information sharing between computers</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Hardware</h4>

                <p>Hardware is the physical/mechanical aspect of a computer. I am interested in learning how the
                    hardware works as I believe that would provide a deeper understanding of how the software works as
                    well. It will also open more possibilities for projects. Finally, having an understanding of
                    hardware may allow me to provide tech support, which might be useful in leftist spaces</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Operating Systems</h4>

                <p>
                    The operating system is the set of software that supports a computer's basic functions. You cannot
                    truly
                    understand how your computer works without understand how its operating system works. Moreover, I am
                    interested in eventually migrating to a Linux distribution, so understanding how operating systems
                    work
                    can help me in deciding which distribution suits my needs best. I appreciate the idea of free
                    open-source software and would like to participate in the community that uses it and contributes to
                    it.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Git and Github</h4>
                <p>
                    Git is one of the most popular and powerful Version Control Systems (VCS). VCS is a software that
                    allows developers to manage all the changes made to a project. <br>
                    Github is a platform that allows collaboration on a project using Git. Github hosts a plethora of
                    open source code and software which allows for a community of strangers to contribute to eachother's
                    projects. This might be an oversimplification, but you can think of it as a Wikipedia for coding in
                    some ways.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
                <p>
                    Cybersecurity is the field that specializes in protecting internet-connected systems. I am
                    interested in this because data collection by corporations and the government is a serious violation
                    of our privacy rights and leftist activists are especially vunerable to surveillance.
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Soldering and Electronics</h4>
                <p id="future-heading">
                    Soldering is the process of joining two metals together. It is useful for wiring electronics where
                    there is limited space (like in a mobile computer). I am interested in learning this as I would like
                    to work on homemade projects that may require soldering.
                </p>
            </li>

            add it to the Completed Projects page which will have meatier descriptions of these projects and my
            thoughts/reflections on them.
